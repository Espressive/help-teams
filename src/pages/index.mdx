## Here’s a list of tabs you can find in Barista for Microsoft Teams:

**Chat:** Here you can interact with Barista, preferably in short sentences,
using the Compose box at the bottom of the screen. For example, you can ask:
“How do I share a file in Drive?” or notify “I have a problem with my laptop,” and
Barista will provide a customized response utilizing sophisticated
Natural Language Processing (NLP) models.


You may continue the conversation using a combination of text, buttons, and other
Barista-provided controls in the chat. You can also reset the conversation at any point by
typing Restart conversation or clicking the Restart button. If a ticket is created, you’ll receive
a notification with a link to the Home tab.

**Home:** This tab shows adaptive cards for each of your tickets, announcements sent to you by
administrators, and approval requests depending on role-based access controls. The cards may be
filtered by clicking on the Type options. Cards are sorted by the last updated first, which you can
change to the oldest updated first.

You’ll see different Menu options for each card depending on the type and lifecycle status of each
item.

The Comment button allows you to add details to your requests including attachments.

You may cancel a ticket by selecting Cancel from the menu. Cards on the Home tab may also contain
links to third-party systems.

In the Home tab, you can also find announcements sent by administrators and requests for you to
approve depending on your role-based access controls.

## Here’s a list of productivity tips on how to use Barista.

### Pin Barista

Barista can be pinned to the app bar so that it's always a click away.

If you cannot see it in your app bar:

1. Click the More apps button (...) on the App bar (left-hand side menu on your screen).
2. Select Barista from the recently used applications or search by typing “Barista” in the search bar.
3. Right-click on the Barista app and select Pin from the contextual menu.

### Unblock Barista

Microsoft Teams gives users the ability to "block" or temporarily disable apps.

If you see a message in the Chat tab stating that "You cannot send messages to this bot because
you've blocked it", you may restore access by right-clicking the Barista app and selecting Unblock
from the contextual menu.
